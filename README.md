# SpaceX Landing Prediction


This is a Data Science capstone project where I will assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting my results to stakeholders.   

I am tasked with predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully.  SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 

Therefore if I can accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, I can determine the cost of a launch. With the help of my Data Science findings and models, the competing startup I have been hired by can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
